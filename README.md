The Core AZURE Services that I have used in my project are as follows:
Static Web Apps
The Static Web Apps is a core AZURE service. In my recent project, I leveraged Azure Static Web Apps to enhance the development and deployment workflow significantly. Here's a breakdown of how this service was utilized:
Repository Integration
Global Reach: With Azure's CDN, our static content, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, was quickly accessible to users around the globe. This improved the user experience by reducing load times.
Serverless API Integration
Custom Domain and SSL
Authentication: Implementing authentication was seamless with Azure Static Web Apps.
Staging Environments: The serviceâ€™s ability to create staging environments for each pull request was invaluable.

The Below is the screenshot that validates the use of above mentioned AZURE service in my project:
